Today, I researched some APIs which is suitable for News App, and attached swfitlint. file into the build phase. 
Currently, I am correcting Swift grammars. Based on this WebSearch API, I will develop a News App.

4/11 API Connections
To Create models for each data. 
1. Use structs
2. For snake casing, we use enum Codingkeys: String, Codingkey.

4/12 News View Updates
1. News navgation view updated
2. News tableView view and header updated
3. News collection View updated (Still constraints issues)

4/18 Updates : MVVM Pattern updates
Task Implemented:
Getting news data with images from the API.
Developing three screens, there are main screen, details screen, search bar screen.
The main screen displays the News title, publication, and thumbnails image.
The detail screen displays the details of news information. This view is scrollable.
The search screen makes that users can search keywords with detailed search options
Display News using the collection and table view.
MVVM Patterns for collection and table
Task needs to be implemented:
Better UI design,
Add more accurate functionally with UI.
Develop share action sheets IOS.
